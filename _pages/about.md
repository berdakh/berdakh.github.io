## About Me

I am a Machine Learning researcher and IEEE Senior Member with 10+ years of experience developing robust AI systems for complex, real-world data.My work focuses on **generalizable representation learning under distribution shift**, particularly for structured, temporal, and multimodal data. I combine deep learning (CNNs, Transformers, hybrid architectures) with strong signal-processing foundations to design models that remain reliable across subjects, domains, and operating conditions.

## Research Pillars
### 1. Robust Representation Learning

Designing deep architectures that generalize across subjects, domains, and environments.

- Distribution shift and domain adaptation  
- Subject-independent modeling  
- Hybrid CNN–Transformer systems  
- Stability under noise and heterogeneity  

### 2. Structured & Temporal Data Modeling

Advanced learning methods for high-dimensional, irregular, and noisy time-series data.

- EEG, iEEG, ECG and physiological signals  
- Event-related potentials and neural decoding  
- Multimodal sensor integration  
- Sequence modeling with attention and state-space approaches  

### 3. Trustworthy & Reproducible AI

Ensuring reliability through principled evaluation.

- Leakage-proof validation pipelines  
- Statistical testing and ablation studies  
- Robust cross-validation frameworks  
- Research-to-production deployment principles

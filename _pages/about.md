## About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher with **10+ years of experience** developing, evaluating, and deploying learning algorithms on complex, real-world data. My research foundation spans **signal processing, deep learning, and statistical methods**, with a track record of shipping systems that generalize reliably across diverse conditions and domains.

I'm transitioning from academia to industry, bringing rigorous research practices, strong fundamentals in representation learning and model evaluation, and demonstrated ability to master new domains quickly. I'm currently expanding my expertise in **large language models** and **computer vision** while maintaining deep knowledge of the ML fundamentals that drive modern systems.

## Technical Expertise

**Core Machine Learning**  
Deep learning architectures (CNNs, Transformers, RNNs, hybrids), representation learning, generalization under distribution shift, model evaluation and validation, statistical analysis of ML systems.

**Computer Vision**  
Image classification, feature extraction, domain adaptation, CNNs and Vision Transformers, evaluation best practices adapted from signal processing experience.

**Large Language Models & NLP**  
Currently deepening expertise in LLM architectures, fine-tuning strategies, prompt engineering, and applications. Strong foundation in sequence modeling from time-series research.

**Signal Processing & Biosignals**  
10+ years specializing in physiological signals (EEG, iEEG, ECG) and sensor data. Expertise in feature engineering, time-series analysis, and domain-specific preprocessing—principles applicable across modalities.

**Research Rigor & Evaluation**  
Leakage-safe cross-validation, ablation studies, statistical significance testing, reproducible experimentation, and honest reporting of failure cases. This disciplined approach transfers directly to industry ML.

## Research Background

**Fundamental Understanding Over Specialization**  
My 10+ years in signal processing and neural signal analysis taught me deep learning fundamentals at a granular level—feature learning, architectural design decisions, generalization challenges—that transfer across domains (vision, language, time-series).

**Generalization & Robustness**  
Research focus on subject-independent learning and cross-domain adaptation directly addresses industry ML's hardest problem: models that work on new data, new users, new conditions. This isn't a niche skill—it's core to deployed systems.

**Rigorous Evaluation**  
Academia taught me to distrust easy wins. I build systems that survive honest evaluation, ablation studies, and edge cases. This mindset prevents the silent failures that plague production systems.

**Learning Agility**  
I've mastered multiple deep learning frameworks, programming languages, and problem domains. Transitioning to LLMs and expanding vision knowledge demonstrates the pattern recognition ability that makes researchers valuable in fast-moving fields.

**Research to Production**  
I've published in top-tier venues *and* built systems deployed in real environments (clinical, industrial). I understand both the rigor academics demand and the constraints engineers face.

## Core Research Areas

**Representation Learning for Complex Data**  
Deep learning on irregular, high-dimensional, noisy data. Expertise with long sequences, multivariate inputs, and learning from limited labeled examples—patterns that appear in vision, language, and signal domains.

**Generalization Under Distribution Shift**  
Subject/domain-independent learning, cross-site adaptation, robustness to covariate shift. Core research theme with direct applications to real-world deployment challenges.

**Deep Learning Architecture Design**  
Systematic evaluation of CNNs, Transformers, hybrid models, and architectural choices. Principled approach to model selection beyond benchmarking.

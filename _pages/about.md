## About Me

I'm a machine learning researcher with 10+ years of experience developing and validating learning algorithms for real-world, high-dimensional, and noisy data. My work bridges the gap between academic research and practical deployment, focusing on models that generalize reliably across subjects, sites, and operating conditions.

My research spans time-series and sensor-based machine learning, with particular expertise in physiological signal processing (EEG, iEEG, ECG) and industrial sensor data. I'm passionate about rigorous evaluation, reproducible research, and building systems that work in the wild—not just in controlled environments.

## Core Research Interests

**Representation Learning for Complex Signals**  
Deep learning architectures for long, irregular, and multivariate sequences. Expertise with CNNs, transformer-based models, and hybrid architectures designed for physiological and sensor data.

**Generalization & Robustness Under Distribution Shift**  
Subject-independent learning, cross-domain adaptation, and reliability across deployment conditions. Strong emphasis on leakage-safe evaluation protocols and rigorous ablation studies.

**Applied Machine Learning for Biosignals**  
End-to-end systems for EEG, iEEG, ECG, and industrial sensor applications, with focus on moving beyond benchmarks to real-world impact.

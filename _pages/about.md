## Berdakh Abibullaev, PhD  
**Senior Machine Learning Engineer / Scientist — Time Series, Sensors, Applied AI**

I am a senior machine learning engineer and applied research scientist with **10+ years of experience building ML systems for real-world, noisy, high-dimensional data**. My work focuses on **time-series and sensor data** (EEG, iEEG, ECG, industrial signals), with an emphasis on **robust generalization, evaluation under distribution shift, and reproducible ML pipelines**.

I operate comfortably across the full ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and modeling to validation, interpretation, and deployment-ready experimentation — and I have led multidisciplinary teams spanning research, engineering, and applied product development.

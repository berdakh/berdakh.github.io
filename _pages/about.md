**About Me**

I am a machine learning researcher with over a decade of experience developing AI-driven solutions in healthcare, neurotechnology, and biomedical engineering. My expertise spans deep learning, neural signal processing, and large-scale data analytics, with a proven record of translating research into real-world impact—including patented brain–computer interface (BCI) rehabilitation systems. 

I have led multidisciplinary teams, mentored graduate students and engineers, and built strong collaborations across academia, industry, and clinical partners to advance the frontiers of AI in neuroscience and healthcare.

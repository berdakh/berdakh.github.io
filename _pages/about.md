## About Me

I am a Machine Learning researcher and IEEE Senior Member with over 10 years of experience developing AI systems for complex, real-world environments. 

Many AI models perform well on benchmarks yet degrade when conditions change. My research addresses this reliability gap. I study generalizable representation learning under distribution shift, with emphasis on non-stationary, high-dimensional, and multimodal data. By integrating statistical signal modeling with modern deep architectures, I develop methods that remain stable across subjects, domains, and operating conditions — enabling AI systems that can be trusted beyond the lab.

## Research Pillars

### 1. Robust Representation Learning

Advancing methods that remain stable under distribution shift and subject variability.

- Domain adaptation and cross-distribution generalization  
- Subject-independent modeling frameworks  
- Hybrid architectures (CNN–Transformer systems)  
- Robustness to noise, heterogeneity, and non-stationarity

### 2. Learning from Temporal & Multimodal Signals

Developing principled models for high-dimensional, non-stationary sensor data.

- Physiological and neural signals (EEG, iEEG, ECG)  
- Event-related and time-locked neural decoding  
- Multimodal sensor fusion  
- Sequential modeling with attention and state-space methods

### 3. Trustworthy & Deployable AI Systems

Building evaluation frameworks that ensure reliability beyond benchmarks.

- Leakage-resistant validation design  
- Statistical rigor and ablation analysis  
- Cross-domain evaluation protocols  
- Research-to-production system design

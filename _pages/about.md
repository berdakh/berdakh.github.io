## About Me

I am a Machine Learning researcher and IEEE Senior Member with 10+ years of experience developing robust AI systems for complex, real-world data.

My work focuses on **generalizable representation learning under distribution shift**, particularly for structured, temporal, and multimodal data. I combine deep learning (CNNs, Transformers, hybrid architectures) with strong signal-processing foundations to design models that remain reliable across subjects, domains, and operating conditions.

## About

My research develops machine learning methods for heterogeneous and non-stationary temporal data, with emphasis on representation learning and robust generalization.

Modern AI systems often perform well under controlled experimental conditions but degrade under distribution shift, subject variability, or real-world deployment constraints. My work examines how to learn representations that remain stable across domains, subjects, sensors, and time.

Neural and physiological signals (EEG, intracranial EEG, ECG) provide a particularly stringent testbed for this problem. The extreme variability of such data forces careful modeling of nuisance variation, inductive bias, and evaluation design. Insights gained in this setting extend naturally to other complex sensor-based systems, including medical monitoring, wearable devices, and industrial time-series analysis.

My work integrates statistical signal processing, deep learning architectures (CNNs and transformers), and system-level evaluation principles to develop AI methods that are not only accurate, but reliable.

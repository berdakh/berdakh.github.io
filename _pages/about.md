## Welcome to my Page!  

I am a machine learning researcher with 10+ years of experience developing and validating learning algorithms for real-world, high-dimensional, and noisy data. My work focuses on time-series and sensor-based machine learning, with emphasis on generalization under distribution shift, rigorous evaluation, and reproducible experimentation**.

I work at the intersection of applied research and engineering, designing models that move beyond benchmarks and remain reliable across subjects, sites, and operating conditions. I have led multidisciplinary research teams and collaborated across academia, industry, and clinical environments.

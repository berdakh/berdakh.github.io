## Berdakh Abibullaev, PhD

Machine learning researcher with over 10+ years of experience in developing, evaluating, and deploying robust AI systems for complex, real-world data. Expertise spans neurotechnology, biosignals, multimodal learning, and foundational deep learning methods that ensure generalization and reliability in high-stakes applications.

My work emphasizes principled approaches to representation learning, domain adaptation, and rigorous model validation—rooted in deep expertise in signal processing and neural signal analysis, with strong foundational understanding of methods that underpin modern computer vision and large language models.


### Research Interests

- **Representation Learning and Generalization**: Designing deep architectures (CNNs, Transformers, hybrids) for irregular, noisy, high-dimensional data; addressing distribution shifts through subject-independent and cross-domain methods.
- **Biosignals and Neuro-AI**: Advanced analysis of physiological signals (EEG, iEEG, ECG); brain-computer interfaces; feature engineering and time-series modeling with applications in healthcare and human-machine systems.
- **Computer Vision and Multimodal AI**: Vision Transformers, domain-invariant features, cross-modal integration; leveraging signal processing principles for robust image classification and adaptation.
- **Large Language Models**: Architectural innovations, fine-tuning techniques, and sequence modeling; applying LLMs to scientific data analysis, clinical decision support, and knowledge extraction.
- **Evaluation and Research Methodology**: Leakage-proof validation, statistical testing, ablation studies, and reproducible frameworks to build trustworthy AI systems.

### Key Accomplishments

- IEEE Senior Member with publications in top-tier venues (IEEE Transactions, IEEE Access, peer-reviewed conferences).
- U.S. Patent 9,081,890: EEG-based rehabilitation training system, exemplifying end-to-end research-to-deployment.
- 1519+ citations (Google Scholar); h-index ~21, reflecting sustained impact in ML and neurotechnology.
- Open-source contributor: ML and signal processing toolkits on GitHub, promoting practical, reusable implementations.
- Technical educator: 3.1K+ YouTube subscribers, distilling complex ML and BCI concepts for broad audiences.

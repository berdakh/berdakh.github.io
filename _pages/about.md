## About Me

I am a Machine Learning researcher and IEEE Senior Member with over 10 years of experience developing AI systems for complex, real-world environments.

Many AI models perform well on benchmarks yet degrade when conditions change. My research addresses this reliability gap. I study generalizable representation learning under distribution shift, with emphasis on non-stationary, high-dimensional, and multimodal data.

By integrating statistical signal modeling with modern deep architectures, I develop methods that remain stable across subjects, domains, and operating conditions — enabling AI systems that can be trusted beyond the lab.



## Research Pillars
### 1. Robust Representation Learning

Designing deep architectures that generalize across subjects, domains, and environments.

- Distribution shift and domain adaptation  
- Subject-independent modeling  
- Hybrid CNN–Transformer systems  
- Stability under noise and heterogeneity  

### 2. Structured & Temporal Data Modeling

Advanced learning methods for high-dimensional, irregular, and noisy time-series data.

- EEG, iEEG, ECG and physiological signals  
- Event-related potentials and neural decoding  
- Multimodal sensor integration  
- Sequence modeling with attention and state-space approaches  

### 3. Trustworthy & Reproducible AI

Ensuring reliability through principled evaluation.

- Leakage-proof validation pipelines  
- Statistical testing and ablation studies  
- Robust cross-validation frameworks  
- Research-to-production deployment principles

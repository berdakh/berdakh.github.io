Our lab focuses on developing robust machine learning methods for neural signal processing, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and clinical neurotechnology. We address challenges in heterogeneous temporal data, representation learning, and real-time closed-loop systems, with applications in epilepsy diagnostics, stroke rehabilitation, and assistive devices.

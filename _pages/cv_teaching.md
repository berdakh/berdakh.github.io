## Professional Summary

Machine learning researcher and engineering leader with 10+ years of experience developing robust AI systems for non-stationary temporal data (EEG, iEEG, multimodal biosignals).  

My work bridges **theory, engineering, and clinical deployment**, with emphasis on:

- Representation learning under distribution shift  
- Transformer-based modeling of long time-series  
- Reliable AI for healthcare (calibration, uncertainty, interpretability)  
- Reproducible ML pipelines for high-stakes environments  

Secured funding as PI/Co-PI and led multidisciplinary research teams spanning academia and clinical partners.

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe engineering and computer science education should develop not only technical competence, but intellectual independence — the ability to reason rigorously, connect theory to practice, and make responsible decisions about technology’s impact on society.

My role as an educator is to design environments where students actively build understanding, solve meaningful problems, and grow into confident engineers and researchers.

My teaching is grounded in over a decade of instruction, active research in machine learning and neural engineering, and a strong technical foundation spanning signal processing, digital design, and biomedical engineering.

## Core Teaching Principles

### 1. Active, Problem-Driven Learning

Students learn best by doing.

Rather than presenting theory in isolation, I anchor concepts in real problems:

- In **Signals and Systems**, students analyze real ECG data before learning Fourier theory.
- In **Machine Learning**, students train models on neural and biomedical datasets instead of toy examples.
- In laboratory courses, students design, implement, debug, and iterate — experiencing engineering as a creative process.

I use short lectures followed by structured problem-solving, hands-on coding, and reflection. This approach promotes deeper understanding and long-term retention.

### 2. Research-Integrated Education

My research in machine learning for neural and biomedical signals directly informs my teaching.

Students do not just learn algorithms — they apply them to real research questions. Many have:

- Implemented state-of-the-art models  
- Contributed to publishable results  
- Presented at IEEE conferences  
- Continued to PhD programs or research careers  

Bringing research into the classroom demystifies discovery and shows students that they can contribute to knowledge creation.

### 3. Inclusive and Structured Course Design

Students enter with diverse backgrounds and preparation levels. I design courses to support growth for all learners through:

- Clear learning objectives and transparent grading  
- Scaffolded assignments that build complexity gradually  
- Frequent low-stakes assessments  
- Multiple formats (lectures, labs, projects, discussions)  
- Emphasis on growth mindset and productive struggle  

I intentionally cultivate an environment where students feel intellectually safe to ask questions, make mistakes, and improve.

### 4. Real-World Relevance and Professional Skills

Engineering education must prepare students for professional practice.

I integrate:

- Industry-relevant tools (Python, PyTorch, embedded systems, FPGA prototyping)
- Technical writing and IEEE-style reporting
- Oral presentations and peer review
- Team-based project development
- Ethical discussions on bias, privacy, and responsible AI

Students leave not only with knowledge, but with practical competence and communication skills.

### 5. Mentorship as a Central Responsibility

Teaching extends beyond the classroom.

Over the past decade, I have mentored:

- Ph.D. students who continued into academic positions  
- M.Sc. students admitted to competitive Ph.D. programs  
- 20+ undergraduates involved in research, several with publications  

I invest in students individually — helping them identify strengths, navigate career paths, and build confidence as engineers and scholars.

## Teaching Practice

I design courses using backward planning:

1. Define learning outcomes  
2. Align assessments with those outcomes  
3. Build activities that support mastery  

A typical class session includes:
- Focused concept introduction  
- Guided group problem-solving  
- Applied demonstration with real data  
- Short reflective assessment  

Laboratory and project components are central to my courses. Students implement complete systems — from signal acquisition and processing to machine learning and evaluation.

## Continuous Improvement

Teaching is a craft that requires reflection and iteration.

I:
- Analyze assessment patterns to refine instruction  
- Incorporate student feedback each semester  
- Engage with scholarship of teaching and learning  
- Stay current with emerging technologies  

My goal is continual improvement — just as I expect from my students.

---

## Closing

I aim for students to leave my courses not only having mastered content, but having developed:

- Structured problem-solving ability  
- Intellectual independence  
- Confidence in tackling complex systems  
- Awareness of ethical responsibility  

Engineering education should empower students to build, question, and innovate responsibly. That is the standard I hold for my teaching.

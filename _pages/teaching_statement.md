# Teaching Statement

Berdakh Abibullaev

## Vision

I believe that engineering and computer science education should develop not merely technical competence, but intellectual independence—the capacity to think critically about complex problems, work effectively across disciplines, and make ethical decisions that shape society. My role as an educator is to design learning environments where students grapple with meaningful challenges, construct understanding through experience, and recognize themselves as capable contributors to their fields.

This philosophy has been forged through rigorous technical training spanning signal processing, digital design, control systems, and biomedical engineering, combined with more than a decade of intentional teaching practice and mentorship of students at all levels.

Foundation: Technical Depth and Breadth

My graduate education—encompassing advanced linear systems theory, signal processing in multiple domains, digital circuit design, control systems, and biomedical engineering—provides the deep technical foundation necessary to teach with authority and authenticity. I completed coursework in linear systems, bio-signal processing, image processing, and random signal processing, equipping me to teach courses ranging from foundational signal processing to specialized applications in biomedical and neural systems. Similarly, preparation in digital logic design, hardware description language, microprocessor-based systems, and VLSI design positions me to teach across the digital systems curriculum with practical, implementation-oriented perspective.

This breadth is not merely a collection of topics. It represents interconnected understanding of how electrical and computer systems work—from transistor-level circuit behavior through high-level signal processing algorithms to systems-level integration. This depth allows me to illuminate connections that help students see the coherence underlying seemingly disparate subjects.

Teaching Philosophy: Five Core Principles

1. Learning Through Active Engagement

I reject the transmission model of teaching—where knowledge flows from professor to student. Instead, I design courses around problems and projects that demand students engage directly with concepts. Rather than lecturing about Fourier transforms, students implement filters in Python on real biomedical signals and see theory become immediately meaningful. Rather than solving abstract control system problems, they design feedback controllers for simulated or physical systems and understand stability empirically.

This approach takes multiple forms: interactive problem-solving in class (think-pair-share, peer instruction), hands-on laboratory work, project-based learning, and direct involvement in research. The evidence is clear: students who build, debug, and iterate learn deeper and retain longer than those who passively absorb.

In my *Signals and Systems* course, I begin not with abstract Fourier analysis but with a clinical problem: how do physicians detect abnormal heart rhythms from noisy ECG signals? Students then develop signal processing pipelines to solve this problem, implementing filters and transforms in Python. They see why they're learning this material because they're solving a real problem. In my *Machine Learning with Applications* course, students work with real datasets—neural signals, sensor data, biomedical measurements—rather than toy problems. This grounds abstraction in concrete reality.

## 2. Research-Informed Teaching

My active research program in machine learning and neural engineering directly informs what and how I teach. I bring current research challenges into the classroom. When teaching neural networks, I share recent results from my lab on deep learning for EEG analysis. This accomplishes multiple goals: it shows students their coursework connects to cutting-edge work; it demonstrates that faculty remain active scholars; it allows me to teach emerging topics not yet in textbooks; and it makes abstract concepts concrete through real applications.

More fundamentally, I involve undergraduate and graduate students directly in research. I have mentored 20+ undergraduates who have published peer-reviewed papers, presented at IEEE conferences, and gone on to competitive graduate programs. This creates a pipeline from coursework to discovery. When students in my *Machine Learning* course work on actual research projects—implementing algorithms, collecting data, analyzing results—they understand that research isn't magic performed only by professionals. It's careful, creative work that they can do.

Research-informed teaching also means staying current with how fields evolve. Signal processing techniques that were cutting-edge five years ago may be superseded by machine learning approaches today. My active research practice ensures I teach students the methods that matter now and that will matter in their careers.

## 3. Inclusive Design for Diverse Learners

Students enter my courses with different backgrounds, prior knowledge, learning preferences, and life circumstances. Some come from strong mathematics preparation; others need support. Some learn through visual demonstration; others through hands-on work. Some balance studies with work or family responsibilities; others can dedicate full-time attention to coursework.

I design courses with these differences in mind:

- **Multiple modalities:** I integrate lectures, interactive demonstrations, hands-on labs, simulations, peer teaching, independent projects, and written reflections. Different students find meaning through different channels.
- **Clear scaffolding:** I explicitly teach not just content but methods. Early in signal processing courses, I teach how to work through a problem systematically—apply the right transform, interpret the result, question whether the answer makes sense. Students learn not just signals but how to think like signal processors.
- **Formative assessment throughout:** Rather than a single high-stakes exam, I use frequent low-stakes quizzes, reflection prompts, peer reviews, and informal feedback to understand where students are struggling. This allows me to adjust instruction and provide targeted support before students fall behind.

- **Growth mindset:** I emphasize that competence develops through effort and productive struggle. I normalize difficulty: "This is hard, and that's where learning happens." I celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities and help students view setbacks as information, not failure.
- **Accessibility:** I provide course materials in multiple formats, offer flexible deadlines for students managing competing demands, ensure laboratory accommodations for students with disabilities, and assess learning in multiple ways recognizing that a single exam doesn't capture what students know.

I also work deliberately to create an inclusive classroom community where students from all backgrounds—including women, students of color, first-generation students, and international students—feel welcomed and capable. I share examples and case studies featuring diverse engineers and scientists. I facilitate peer mentoring and study groups. I maintain open office hours and write detailed recommendation letters. These relationships communicate that I believe in students' potential and that their success matters to me.

## 4. Real-World Application and Professional Preparation

Engineering and computer science education should connect to the world graduates will enter. Pure theory without application becomes abstraction disconnected from meaning. Pure applications without conceptual grounding become rule-following without understanding.

I integrate both systematically:

- **Industry and clinical relevance:** When teaching signal processing, I show how these methods power medical devices, hearing aids, brain-computer interfaces, and consumer electronics. I invite students to consider: Who benefits from this technology? What are potential harms? How would you design responsibly?
- **Emerging technologies:** I ensure courses reflect current practice. Machine learning is now central to many engineering domains. Signal processing increasingly uses deep learning rather than traditional methods. Digital design now involves FPGA prototyping and hardware-software codesign. I teach these contemporary tools and methods.
- **Professional communication:** Engineers must communicate technical ideas to colleagues, clients, non-technical stakeholders, and the public. I assign technical writing, presentations, and peer reviews, giving feedback on clarity and organization. Students draft IEEE-style research papers, present findings to diverse audiences, and practice explaining technical concepts to non-experts.
- **Teamwork and leadership:** Modern engineering happens in teams. I structure most projects collaboratively, explicitly teaching team dynamics, conflict resolution, and inclusive leadership. I ask students to reflect on team interactions and their own contributions.
- **Ethical dimensions:** Every technology has potential harms. Algorithms may embed bias. Signal processing may violate privacy. Designs may have unequal impacts across populations. I integrate discussions of responsible innovation, technical bias, accessibility, and environmental impact throughout the curriculum.

## 5. Mentorship as Central to Teaching

Beyond formal coursework, I mentor students through office hours, research supervision, graduate school advising, and informal conversations. I write detailed recommendation letters highlighting specific strengths and achievements. I help students navigate career decisions and professional development. I also involve interested students in my research program.

These relationships often become the most meaningful part of students' educational experience. When students know that a faculty member believes in their potential, values their growth, and will invest time in their development, their engagement and confidence transform.

Over the past 10+ years, I have mentored 2 Ph.D. students (both now placed in postdoctoral/faculty positions), 8 M.Sc. students (multiple now in competitive Ph.D. programs), and 20+ undergraduates (many in graduate school or industry roles, several with published papers). This track record demonstrates that mentoring isn't separate from teaching—it's central to developing capable, confident engineers and computer scientists.

## Teaching in Practice

### Classroom Design and Pedagogy

I design courses using backward planning: start with learning objectives, then align activities and assessments to those objectives. A well-designed course is transparent—students understand what they'll learn, why it matters, and how they'll demonstrate competence.

I use active learning extensively. In a typical course meeting, I might begin with a brief concept introduction (10-15 minutes), follow with interactive problem-solving in small groups (20 minutes where students work together while I circulate, observe, and provide feedback), then demonstrate application with real data or simulation (10 minutes), and conclude with a reflection prompt students submit (5 minutes). This keeps students engaged and gives me formative data about understanding.

I create detailed syllabi that communicate expectations clearly, make course structure transparent, and convey that I've invested thoughtfully in course design. I maintain office hours and respond to email promptly. I provide frequent feedback on assignments, pointing out what students did well, what needs improvement, and how to improve. This specific, actionable feedback helps students learn effectively.

### Laboratory and Project-Based Learning

Where appropriate, I include substantial laboratory or project components. In *Signals and Systems*, students use Python and real data to implement signal processing pipelines. In *Machine Learning*, students train neural networks on biomedical datasets and evaluate model performance. In *Brain-Machine Interfaces*, students implement complete BCI systems from signal acquisition through real-time decoding.

These activities serve multiple purposes: they build hands-on competence, they make abstract concepts concrete, they give students confidence they can do technical work, and they connect classroom learning to professional practice.

### Research Integration

For advanced students, I supervise independent and group research projects. These might involve analyzing data from my lab, implementing published algorithms, or exploring novel questions. Students conduct literature reviews, design experiments, implement methods, analyze results, and write papers. Some results have been published in peer-reviewed venues.

This research experience teaches that science and engineering are creative, incremental, and social endeavors. It normalizes failure as part of discovery. It develops independence and intellectual maturity. And it often opens pathways to graduate school or research careers.

### Assessment and Continuous Improvement

I assess student learning through multiple means: quizzes and exams, projects and design challenges, presentations and written work, peer reviews, and reflections on learning. This diversity recognizes that students demonstrate competence in different ways and that a single assessment method doesn't capture full understanding.

I analyze patterns in student performance and use that information to improve teaching. If many students struggle with a concept, that's data that my explanation needs revision. If a particular activity doesn't engage students, I redesign it. I take student evaluations seriously, reading feedback carefully and implementing suggestions. I attend workshops on teaching and learning, read scholarship on pedagogy, and incorporate evidence-based practices.

Teaching is a craft that improves with deliberate practice, reflection, and feedback. Each semester, I adjust my approach based on what I learned about student learning the previous term.

## Scholarship of Teaching and Learning

I don't view teaching as separate from scholarship. Good teaching involves learning about learning—understanding how students develop competence in signal processing, machine learning, systems thinking. I regularly reflect on teaching effectiveness, read current research on pedagogy and learning sciences, and when possible, contribute to conversations about teaching excellence in engineering and computer science.

Specifically, I have found that:

- **Active learning with real data increases engagement and retention** compared to abstract examples
- **Involving undergraduates in research simultaneously develops technical competence and professional maturity**
- **Multiple assessments better capture student understanding** than single high-stakes exams
- **Explicit instruction in problem-solving process is as important as content knowledge**
- **Community and belonging significantly affect student persistence and success**

These observations come from my practice and from the literature. I continue to study teaching as a serious, intellectual endeavor.

## Vision for the Future

As I advance in my career, I want to deepen several dimensions of my teaching:

**First, scaling impact:** I have successfully mentored individual students through independent research and capstone projects. I want to expand this model, creating courses where research and learning are integrated for many more students. This might involve developing a cohort-based research course, establishing a student-led research club, or creating a "research-as-teaching" seminar series.

**Second, educational equity:** I have worked with diverse student populations and seen how belonging and mentorship transform outcomes, particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. I want to continue building inclusive courses and mentoring relationships. I want to be deliberate about creating pathways to advanced study and professional success for students who might not see themselves in traditional STEM.

**Third, integration of emerging technologies:** Fields evolve. Machine learning is transforming signal processing and many other areas. Quantum computing is emerging. The skills students need shift. I want to stay at the forefront of curricular innovation, ensuring students learn methods that will be relevant throughout their careers.

**Fourth, discipline-specific communities:** Teaching is stronger when embedded in communities of practice. I want to continue active engagement with my professional communities—IEEE, conference organizations, departmental colleagues—to stay current with what's being taught, how teaching is being done, and what innovations are emerging.

## Conclusion

Teaching is among the highest callings—shaping the next generation of engineers and computer scientists, developing their technical capabilities and their characters, preparing them to solve problems and make decisions that affect society.

I approach teaching with intentionality, creativity, care, and intellectual rigor. I design courses where students engage actively with meaningful problems, where diverse learners find pathways to competence and confidence, where research and practice inform teaching, and where mentorship supports individual growth. I believe that students should leave my courses not just having learned specific content but having experienced intellectual growth, having developed problem-solving capabilities, and having recognized themselves as capable contributors to their fields.

My commitment to teaching excellence—grounded in rigorous technical preparation, informed by a decade of practice, sustained by ongoing reflection and professional engagement—prepares me to make meaningful contributions to any program's educational mission.

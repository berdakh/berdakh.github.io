I have designed and taught core and elective courses in the Robotics & Mechatronics program at Nazarbayev University (2015–present), emphasizing active, hands-on learning with real-world applications in signals, machine learning, neural interfaces, and embedded systems.

Courses feature Python/PyTorch/MNE-Python implementations, hardware labs (OpenBCI, FPGA, microcontrollers), and research-integrated projects — many resulting in student IEEE publications.

## Teaching Preparation & Approach

My preparation to teach stems from rigorous graduate training at Yeungnam University (M.S. Electronic Engineering 2004–2006; Ph.D. Engineering 2006–2010), where I completed advanced coursework with high performance (GPA ~3.94–3.95/4.50 Korean scale, mostly A/A+ grades) in signal processing, systems theory, digital/VLSI design, control, biomedical engineering, and emerging areas. This foundation, combined with 10+ years of faculty experience, equips me to teach core and specialized topics effectively.

**Prepared to teach across the following areas** (with key supporting graduate courses):

### Signal Processing & Biomedical Signals
- Bio-Signal Processing, Random Signal Processing
- Image Signal Processing Theory, Multimedia Signal Processing (Integrated Topics & Special Topics)
- Digital Image Processing
- **Related taught courses**: Signals and Systems (modernized with biomedical labs), Brain-Machine Interfaces (EEG/iEEG focus)

### Digital Design, Circuits & Embedded Systems
- Digital Logic Design, Hardware Description Language
- Design of Electronic Circuits, Integrated Signal Circuit Engineering
- Design of Microprocessor-Based Systems, VLSI System Design
- Semiconductor Devices
- **Related taught courses**: ROBT 206 Microcontrollers with Lab (FPGA/Arduino/Quartus focus)

### Machine Learning, AI & Data-Driven Methods
- (Built on strong signal processing foundation + self-directed research/teaching in ML)
- Neural networks, deep learning, supervised/unsupervised methods (integrated into recent courses)
- **Related taught courses**: ROBT 407 Machine Learning with Applications (PyTorch/Scikit-learn projects), Statistical Methods and Machine Learning

### Biomedical & Neural Engineering
- Introduction to Biomedical Measurement
- Advanced Bioelectronic Engineering
- **Related taught courses**: Brain-Machine Interfaces (hands-on BCI pipelines with OpenBCI/MNE-Python)

### Emerging & Interdisciplinary Areas
- Multimedia Engineering topics
- **Potential electives**: Computer Vision, Data Science, AI for Medical Devices, Cyber-Physical Systems

**Approach**: Active, project-based learning with real datasets/hardware; research integration (e.g., current transformer/BCI results); inclusive design (multiple modalities, scaffolding, formative feedback); emphasis on ethical AI, interpretability, and professional skills (communication, teamwork). Student outcomes include 30+ publications from projects and consistent 4.5/5.0 ratings.

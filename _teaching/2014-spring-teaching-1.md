ROBT 407 introduces students to advanced analytical tools and techniques in machine learning. The course covers supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, deep learning, support vector machines, decision trees, linear discrimination, and kernel-based learning methods. It also explores machine learning experiment design. Students engage in term projects using Python-based machine learning packages such as Scikit-learn, PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, as well as online databases.
